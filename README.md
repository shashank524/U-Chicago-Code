Here are a few optimizations that could be made to reduce the time the code takes to do calculations:

Use vectorization: Instead of using loops to calculate values, it's often faster to use vectorization. For example, instead of using a loop to calculate S[i, j], you could use the numpy function np.power() to calculate u**j * d**(i-j).

Remove unnecessary calculations: The code currently calculates the entire S matrix, but only the last row is used to calculate the call price. Instead of creating the entire S matrix, you could just calculate the last row as needed.

Pre-calculate constant values: The values of dt, u, d, and p are constant throughout the calculation, so they can be pre-calculated outside of the loop to save time.

Here's an updated version of the code with these optimizations:
